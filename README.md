Coursework for Web Application Development 2.  
01/02/2025  
Today I started to do this coursework, now a file .gitignore has been created.  
The first push is done at 1:35 am. Have created the basic shell of a Django app.  
1:46 am, I made an action to remove db.sqlite3, that means I know how to set up .gitignore and to remove file from remote repository.

Coursework for Web Application Development 2.  
01/02/2025  
Today I started to do this coursework, now a file .gitignore has been created.  
The first push is done at 1:35 am. Have created the basic shell of a Django app.  
1:46 am, I made an action to remove db.sqlite3, that means I know how to set up .gitignore and to remove file from remote repository.  
Chapter 3  
INSTALLED_APPS_Rango/settings.py, add_HttpResponse_views/rango, urls.py_rangoinclude(), rango/urls_setup  
This version already set up basic things covered in Chapter 3, there's a hit says that i should make a push. I do think so because I do have lost all i work because not pushed after a period of work.

Pass Chapter 3 test. OK.
